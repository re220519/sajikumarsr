                              <p class="mt-4 mb-0">In his message to the citizens of India, he could have said the secret of his health. The misconception of India’s traditional
                                   medicine as a placebo would have been over, had he shared the secret of his good health and energy.<br>
                                   <br>
                                On 21st October, by noon, I read the news that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would address the nation at 6 PM on that day. Like many people in our country,
                                 as usual, I was afraid. Still, I maintained a ray of relief. The Prime Minister would not make a bad time worse. The time was not 8 PM, but 6 PM. I consoled
                                  myself, thinking that it would not be as terrifying as that 8 PM address, that once had sung a dirge on cash hoarders and those engaged in the business that
                                   worked only on hard cash.<br>
                                   <br>
                                </div> 
                                <div class="col-lg-3 py-lg-4">

                               </div>
                               <p class="mt-0 mb-0">Soon I returned to my routine work. I had some part of my next book’s manuscript to be read. Then I went out for tea and returned
                                    soon to resume my remaining work. The momentous 6 PM was over. Luckily, there was no bad news that shocked me or anyone waiting for the Prime Minister’s 
                                    evening shot. At least, there was nothing to panic this time. He stuck to his tweet that he wanted to convey a message. A great escape for those who were too afraid.<br>
                                    <br>
                                  His subject was public health and called for maintaining caution against the infection. In his address to the nation, he advised people to be careful and wear masks until
                                     the vaccine is ready.<br>
                                     <br>
                                     After a sigh of relief, I wished the PM’s address to be franker because he is boldly different from other prime ministers whom India had seen. Modi was cast in a different
                                      ideological mould. So I expected him to be bold in expressing his ideological commitment through some special announcement. But I was annoyed by the way he shied away from
                                       his own school of thoughts espoused by the RSS. The thoughts were steeped in India’s Sanskruti. India has its own admirable healthcare, which the apostles of modern medicine
                                        write off as a placebo. As a well-trained RSS Swayamsevak he should have called for citizens’ return to India’s traditional medicines. His call would have made a big difference.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        They always talk about the Bharatiya Sanskriti and Atmanirbhar Bharat. He is a living example of how to live a good lifestyle through India’s traditional healthcare system. He believes
                                         in yoga and Ayurveda and practises to remain healthy and energetic. He talks about Sanatan Dharma and is known to have decided to live the life of a Sadhu after his tenure as PM.<br>
                                         <br>
                                         He stays healthy by doing yoga, having a sunbath and Ayurvedic medicine. He could have praised the practice and shared his experience with people. By recommending Yoga and Ayurveda for
                                          staying safe from Covid-19, the so-called world of science would have called him unscientific. But the truth is the truth. No need to be afraid of taking it boldly. No need for sacrificing
                                           one’s honesty, especially ideological honesty, if that has proven to be perfect. But it seemed, by shying away from recommending India’s traditional healthcare system rooted in our Sanskruti,
                                            PM has moved far.<br>
