                                   compels the most intelligent animal on earth to be more self-centered in the name of precaution. The gap of relationship is widening and each of us
                                    is moving into seclusion under duress.<br>
    <br>
                                    The Greek philosopher and polymath, Aristotle said, “man is by nature a social animal”. It was after the era of Aristotle, every pandemic caused by
                                     human-to-human transmission that historians noted had happened. Pandemic might have happened in the ancient days too but without too wide a call for social
                                      distancing as we see now. The world was much larger at that time unlike what we call it today as a village. As the world shrank,could

                                    <br>
                                     How the pandemic until last century influenced human relations was not known to anyone, nor anyone knew about any research of social scientists over
                                      a change in equation of human relations after each pandemic. Whatever the result of that exploration be, the 21st century pandemic is teaching us a big lesson about human
                                       relations. The lesson is not only being taught leaving no doubts behind but also being felt deeply by our minds.<br>
                                       <br>
                                       Owing to the high level transmitting nature of the corona virus, the pandemic has called for quarantine of infected ones and a social distancing for others to stay safe from
                                        an infection. It was through quarantine and social distancing the deadly Spanish Flu, the previous pandemic, was said to have been brought under control after two years of havoc.
                                         That was only a popular belief. When we blindly replicated the defensive model, we did not address the challenge of modern society. A century is too long a period to bring in a change to any society..<br>
                                         <br>
                                         We are taught to believe that the more we become secluded, the better our chances to be safe. For the social being called man, as nature has created, it is as big a tragedy as a self-exile within four walls
                                          of your living room. In the process, we have assigned our relationship building process to the cutting edge communication technology. Our relationship has shrunk to making calls and doing chats. But these
                                           exercises have limitations, as we are self-regulated to make use of it only for a dedicated purpose.<br>

                                           An average individual meets many people every day on his way, be it a morning walk or running to the workplace. A person meets many people on the way.Nobody keeps any count of it. Familiar faces exchange
                                            smiles and talks. It is unimaginable for anyone with a sound mind not to see anyone outside the home for many days. We are familiar with the story of Robinson Crusoe who had been trapped in a desolate island
                                             and suffered the agony of loneliness. The pandemic has made each one live without any social touch. Neighbours are afraid of exchanging smiles. In work urban places many colleagues have gone away to places where 
                                             they feel safe. A good number of them vow not to return, ending all their relations with the town where they once had a hope.<br>
                                             <br>
                                             The pandemic has realigned people’s relationships to a worse degree. Urban life has undergone a radical change that is not something to boast about. In normal circumstances also, human relationships in urban 
                                             atmosphere are not something great to talk about.<br>
                                             <br>
                                             The pandemic has further severed the relationship, thanks to the mantra of social distancing. The sound of a neighbour’s cough or sneezing makes us panic, and even angry often. People are afraid of seeing their
                                              neighbors opening their door. Exchanging smiles between neighbours has gone out of time. Many people in masks are gasping as if they have pulmonary disease. The world is moving to embrace a new equation as the
                                               pandemic continues to ravage mankind. Aristotle’s social animal is celebrating a social distance; yet the species is the same<br>
