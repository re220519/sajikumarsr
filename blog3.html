                                 sun towards their villages’ miles away. Many are accompanied with family and small kids also.  Since the starting of lockdown the pathetic condition these migrated daily wage workers of big cities are going to face was disturbing my mind, and now it is in front of my eyes!!!.<br>
                                 <br>
                                 I sincerely wanted to stop my vehicle and ask them where they are going even though it will not make any difference in their misery. I am constantly thinking over this matter now days. What did they do to endure through 
                                 such misery and trouble, where even their basic needs are not met? This relaxation, allowing essentials/not

                                <p class="mt-0 mb-0"> allowing something is for those who are in their homes. What
                                  about those in streets? When govt can’t help them, why going for a national shutdown back to back.<br>
                                
          When the one-day Janata curfew was declared, we never thought that a long extension that is going to happen. Before announcing such a decision Govt should have at least be ready with some plans for those who can be in trouble
                                 due to the sudden cut off? In his announcement PM requested, to not to fire anyone from their job and not to cut off salary. But How many employers can bear this? Those who are in streets now, are those who lost their livelihood due to the shutdown. They are neither allowed to continue in their workplace nor they can travel back to native.<br>
                                 <br>
                                
                                It is estimated that 139 million is the strength of migrant workers who have migrated for their livelihood within the country. Majority of them is concentrated in cities like Mumbai and Pune, miles away from their home.
                                 The way Gov. consider about the essential services of people, the basic need of these population was also important. While those with ration card and other cards are provided with relief, this population is being deprived from the covid-relief resources like ration and essentials.<br>
                                 <br>
                                
                                No proper drinking water in this hot summer, no ration, no safety. Does anyone know this? Aren’t they the son of same mother India?  I am surprised that there is no one even thinking on this! - no public, no Governing bodies, no organisation, no opposition parties !<br>
                                <br>
                                
                                The decision to lock the country was anyway an unwise step, moreover without considering the “to be affected” band of people, was more idiotic in my opinion. They should have distributed the needful eatables and other materials against one’s Aadhar card instead of ration card, as most of people carry it.<br>
                                <br>
                                
                                Death toll directly due to covid is being counted and reported, but on the other hand deaths due to starvation, inadequate medical care, stress, depression etc. is also happening which remains uncounted and not reported as they don’t have new value.<br>
                                <br>
                                Have you ever given a thought on what attitude should we expect from people who comes out of the pupa after the lock down? The virtual fear, which has been created over these 3 months is going to stay in us forever. Although jobs are available,
                                 people can’t work in harmony and calm. Because the mental condition, fear and insecurity remains unanswered.<br>
                                 <br>

                                Many industries will go years back to regain in their pre-lock down working status.  Gov. allowed some vehicles to run and kept the garage, workshops and spare parts shops closed. Does it make any sense?<br>
                                Again, I want to say, this fear is more physiological than real and it is not going to leave us easily.  There is a small Adivasi colony in the remote side of Karjat city in Vanjerwadi village called …... where
                                 the whole population of about 70-80 families flew to jungle in the fear of covid. Some kind of fake or unsure news was the reason behind this. Cities have been bifurcated into coloured zones, which is also panicking people.
                                  Even after being locked for weeks, people feel unsafe even in their homes because of being in a red zone. Due to the strict lockdown and maximum utilisation including long working hours police force has lost their optimism.
                                   They are literally fed up with the public and the Gov. I personally experienced it. During my travels in lockdown time, I had to visit some police stations and met cops for allowing pass. I can understand the desperate as well as
                                    fearful condition now prevailing among them. Although late, If Gov. can create containment zones and introduce reverse lock down, force can be utilized more efficiently.<br>
                                    <br>
                                
                                Lockdown treatment for the country turned to be more dangerous than the disease. It’s of sure that the repairing and maintenance of machines, minds and lives will be left behind as a big question mark during post lockdown era !<br>
