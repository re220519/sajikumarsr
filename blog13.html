                                  large section of people. The logic behind supporting a section of people with money, though they don’t require it, 
                                  lies in some strange calculations. But if it is deployed in a segment where there is a spending urgency, at least 18 percent of
                                   it will return to the exchequer. When the government employees, who already get more than what they require for spending in a month,
                                    are given an advance, they may use it only for savings. However, if the poor people are given an interest-free advance, their spending would have
                                     returned 18 per cent to the government exchequer by way of various direct taxes.<br>

                                   <p class="mt-0 mb-0">Morning, 12th October 2020, a friend sent me a message, “FM to address the media at 12.30 noon.” All economic and equity
                                        market analysts were anxiously counting down their time. Predictions and projections began to flood the media. Expectations ran high. All
                                         we’re waiting for is another round of a package bonanza.<br>
                                         <br>
                                         The announcement came on time. “The proposals being presented are designed in a way that can stimulate demand by front-loading or advancing
                                          some of the expenditure with some offsetting changes. Others are directly linked to an increase in the GDP”. Along with this, the Finance Minister
                                           Nirmala Sitaraman’s announcement of an additional capital expenditure program of Rs 25,000 crore wasn’t bought by anyone with great enthusiasm. I was
                                            not amused even a bit. The pre-announcement celebration of all the economy watchers ended. The government employees sported a big smile on their face.
                                             The government also has been happy. Stock markets did not show any remarkable response, though it should have been based on the government’s safe play. 
                                             The rest of the segment resumed their normal job finding no scope for further discussion. Analysts moved out of their war rooms without noting the fact 
                                             that the advance to the government employees if spent, will return to the exchequer. This is an indication that the government is working hard to see all
                                              tax collections are going up.<br>
                                              <br>
                                              Ten days later, after a protest by employees, the government approved an 18-day wages equivalent bonus for all non-gazetted Railway employees.
                                               With Rs 2081 crore allocation, nearly 1.16 million employees will get the bonus. The bonus is called productivity linked benefit. In the lockdown period,
                                                most of the railway employees had their works less than a quarter of what they were supposed to have. God only knows what may be the productivity during the
                                                 days of full lockdown and partial lockdown. Almost the same time, Cabinet approved a bonus payment for three million government employees, which will cost the exchequer Rs 3737 crore.<br>
                                                 <br>
                                                 The government employees were the only sections among people unaffected by the lockdown. Incidentally, they were the section that got an interest-free festival advance of Rs 10,000. The government
                                                  could have done this without hosting a special media meet of the Finance Minister. The suspense initially generated many guesses, which lost all steam soon. In fact, after the announcement the larger
                                                   public was unimpressed.<br>
                                                   <br>
                                                   The government employees have never been poor nor could they have ever been subjected to anyone’s sympathy for their financial position. They were, in fact, the luckier section of people who used to get
                                                    their salary on time during the inexplicable crisis period of lockdown. No one could be foolish enough to believe that the government was unaware of the truth. Similarly, none could be foolish enough not
                                                     to believe that the government was uninformed about poverty faced by many of the citizens. Compared with an average Indian, the Central government employees are well off. They have enough to spend every month,
                                                      which they otherwise also would have been doing. Giving them advance to make them spending couldn’t have been the only option for the government to boost the GDP.<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      It was just three days after the announcement of the cash advance bonanza India was re-ranked down to the 102nd level from the earlier 83rd rank in the Global Hunger Index 2019. The position is below the level
                                                       of Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal. A proud Indian like me was heavily annoyed. If poor people are supported with financial resources, that would have not only added to the growth of GDP but also India’s socio-economic
                                                        scenario. I believe, elimination of poverty has a higher priority than finding new ways to make government employees happier.<br>
                                                        <br>
                                                        When the Central government employees opt for the festival advance, the plan will cost around Rs 5675 crore and when all PSU employees opt, it will cost Rs 1900 crore, the Finance Minister estimated. In terms of the 
                                                        fund size and view of the nature of support, the overall strain on the Central budget may be minuscule. The LTC cash voucher bonanza was so lavish that would create an impression that the government is sitting on a fatty
                                                         cash cushion, while the overall revenue is set to shrink along with the contraction of the economy. The government has already spent much more than what was provisioned in the budget. There is also a huge interest subsidy
                                                          burden on its head. The moratorium rendered interest on interest burden also will have to be met, if the government wants the lenders to forsake the burden.<br>
                                                          <br>
                                                          The Finance Minister has brilliantly justified the action, pointing at demand creation with the new advance pumping. The announcement has shown that the government is not the government of a republic, but a corporate entity,
                                                           which declares a board meeting decision. Board is concerned with its shareholders, so is the government with the employees, who become stakeholders in the national wealth.<br>
                                                           <br>
                                                           The base of poor people in India is too wide. They have huge needs in their daily life. They can meet their needs only if money comes to their hands. As the money comes to their hands, they will spend it to meet their basic
                                                            needs, while those with regular income will seek a lucrative investment avenue, instead of spending it immediately. Poor people would spend what they get to meet their needs. Naturally, they are the largest section of people 
                                                            who can fire the demand and jostle the economy. If the government is very serious about creating demand for triggering economic growth, it should have found a way to see money reaching the hands of those who live at the bottom
                                                             of the pyramid. Had the government thought of provisioning the same size of advance through public sector lenders to extremely poor rural women to run a self-help group and find their livelihood, more poor families would have
                                                              come out of their poverty. That would have contributed to inclusive growth. At least, some people facing abject poverty could have carried a smile on their face. Such an advance should have been designed for unemployed widows of Covid-19 victims.<br>
                                                              <br>
                                                              Economically bad times sometimes become good times for a section. They live happier when the vast majority in society face darker prospects. The government employees have always been a lucky lot. Their job is largely safe even if they don’t perform. 
                                                              We have rarely seen under-performers being sacked. Most punishment is limited to giving them a transfer. At the rarest times, the most serious errant ones are given compulsory retirement with a pension. That is a kind of blessing. In the colonial days
                                                               also they had been sahibs. Now also they are peppered in every possible way, this time in the name of boosting the ailing economy through demand creation.<br>
                                                               <br>
                                                               Time is miserably bad for a vast majority of the denizens. The government could have asked the public servants to share a part of the country’s economic woe for the time being given the prevailing economic urgency. Instead, they have been added with more
                                                                money, as if they were the first sufferers of the lockdown and consequent economic trouble. While the government’s burden is rising, the economy is contracting. The budget is looming large with a threat of high inflation. People at the bottom of the pyramid 
                                                                will be put to suffer more severely. Poor people continue to be extremely poorer, as the government seems to have overlooked their economic anguish. They are thrown to carry the bigger burden of the ruthless, avoidable, and untimely lockdown. For some,
                                                                 luck comes to bless even at other’s bad times. The talks of inclusive growth remain only as markers on the water surface.<br>
                                                                 ********</p>
